        My family and I have been regular visitors to Osaka for the last 10
        years and each visit we have stayed with Apollo Properties. The
        apartments are always clean and have everything we need. Bruce and
        Masatoshi are highly professional and we always feel looked after. We
        recommend Apollo apartments to family and friends when they come to stay
        and they are always impressed with the value, price and location. And
        that is why we will continue to book with them.

        I've been a tenant with Apollo Properties for almost a year. Bruce and
        Masatoshi have been very helpful since my move to Japan. They're very
        quick to respond and get a hold of. Bruce was able to help me set up my
        internet and replace a couple of appliances that have broken within a
        day. Staying at Apollo Properties have been instrumental to my move to
        Japan.

        From the moment I originally wrote to them up until my check out after
        four years and a half of living in an apartment provided by Apollo
        Properties, I've always felt like I was in good hands. Incredibly kind
        and helpful English speaking staff always giving great assistance and
        help, along with a comprehensible apartment contract without any hidden
        fees or complicated clauses made my time staying with Apollo Properties
        a relaxing one, during which I felt right at home from day one, also
        helped by the fact that the apartment came fully furnished and equipped
        with everything it needed to function. I highly recommend Apollo
        Properties! I'm not sure if your new website will feature ratings, but
        if it does I would definitely rank my stay overall a 5 out of 5! Thank
        you again for the great service during the last four years and a half!

        Apartments are in good locations for transport. Having the apartment
        set-up with the essentials made it an easy move-in process. Bruce is
        always quick to respond to any questions about the apartment or
        appliances, and maintenance has always been organised quickly.

        As a current tenant of an Apollo Properties apartment for over a year.
        Bruce and Masatoshi have always provided very helpful assistance, and
        are quick to respond to any emails and queries regarding the apartment
        and local amenities. The apartment itself has served as a fantastic
        home-base to life in Osaka and is located in a very convenient, yet
        quiet location, with great transport links nearby to easily explore the
        myriad of hotspots the city has to offer. The apartment also came fully
        furnished, including white goods and working internet from day 1, which
        made for a hassle-free move and meant I could settle in right away. I
        would highly recommend Apollo Properties if you want to enjoy a
        stress-free stay in Osaka, whether your trip is for just a few days or
        much longer.

        When we moved to Nagoya from Australia, Apollo made our transition a
        much smoother process than it would have been if we'd tried to organise
        our own accommodation. Everything was organised for us - gas,
        electricity and internet. Electricity and gas bills are paid through
        Apollo too, reducing the number of monthly bills we have to remember to
        pay. We have an older apartment in a convenient location in the centre
        of the city and it came furnished with everything we need for daily
        life. Our monthly rent seems quite reasonable considering the
        convenience of the location and Apollo's services.

        Renting my apartment from Apollo Properties was the easiest thing I did
        when moving to Japan. The process of viewing the apartment and moving in
        was seamless. I read so many stories online about how difficult it is
        for foreigners to rent in Japan, but Apollo Properties made all those
        worries disappear. They offer great prices in prime locations around
        Japan. The staff is wonderful to chat with and they always make sure
        everything is going well in the apartment. I couldn't recommend a better
        company to work with!

            We lived in the Sanko Heights building in Osaka from April 2014
            until July 2020. Bruce was an excellent landlord to us for those six
            years. He always gave us a copy of our bill so we could keep track
            of our expenses, and the payment process by bank account transfer
            was easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The apartment was pre-furnished, and whenever we had any issues with
            any furniture in the apartment, all we had to do was let Bruce know,
            and he would replace that furniture for free. We had items such as
            our refrigerator and microwave replaced when those items had issues
            or malfunctioned, and it was always an easy and smooth process.
            Bruce always responded to any of our requests or issues within a
            very timely manner, and it was always a pleasure talking to him and
            his associate Masatoshi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever there were any non-furniture issues, which were instead
            fixed by the owner of the building, Bruce was very helpful in
            facilitating contact with the owners, who only spoke Japanese. We
            can speak Japanese to an extent, but it was always reassuring to
            know that Bruce would help us out with that communication if
            necessary. There were a few emergencies that happened during our
            time there, but with his help they were always resolved quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rent rate, for a furnished apartment in the heart of Osaka, was
            very reasonable, and all the furniture was of great quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bruce assisted us in moving in by picking us up from our bus from
            the airport when we arrived in Japan in 2014. After we lived in
            temporary housing for a month, he also helped us move into our
            apartment. When we moved out, he assisted us with that as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            After we moved out of the apartment, Bruce was very straightforward
            and timely with communicating with us regarding the return of our
            deposit. The deposit situation was just as it was originally written
            in our contract, and we were very grateful that we were able to
            receive our deposit back, since this can be very difficult in Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were both very grateful for all the help, assistance, and quick
            communication provided over the years. We would recommend Apollo
            Properties to anyone needing a decent and well-priced apartment in
            Japan, especially for foreigners who are new to Japan and don't
            understand all the ins and outs of renting in Japan.
